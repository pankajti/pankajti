# 👋 Pankaj Kumar

Hi, I'm Pankaj — a technologist with over 20 years of experience across software engineering, data science, and AI-driven financial platforms. I've built enterprise-scale systems for risk management, trading, and analytics in fast-paced environments across the UK, Singapore, and India.

I specialize in bridging deep technical execution with strategic business impact — from deploying low-latency trading pipelines to developing multi-agent LLM applications.
